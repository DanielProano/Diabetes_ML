# Diabetes Scikit ML

A machine learning project for predicting the onset of diabetes using the [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/) library and the well-known diabetes dataset.

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to apply machine learning techniques to a medical dataset to predict diabetes progression. The goal is to explore, preprocess, and model the data effectively while gaining insights into key factors influencing diabetes outcomes.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and categorization
- Model training with multiple algorithms (Linear Regression and Ridge)
- Scoring the model to determine how well they did
- Small visualization using MatPlotLib
